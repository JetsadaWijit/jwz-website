# Commit Conventions

## Format

```
type(optional scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

## Types

| Type | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `feat` | Introduces a new feature. Minor in semantic versioning. |
| `fix` | Patches a bug. Patch in semantic versioning. |
| `docs` | Documentation only. |
| `style` | Formatting that does not change behavior. |
| `refactor` | Restructuring that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature. |
| `perf` | Improves performance. |
| `test` | Adds or corrects tests. |
| `build` | Build system or packaging. |
| `ci` | Continuous integration configuration. |
| `chore` | Maintenance that does not touch source behavior. |
| `revert` | Reverts a previous commit. |

A breaking change is marked with `!` after the type or scope, and explained in a
`BREAKING CHANGE:` footer. Here that means a change to the URL of a published
page, because an existing link to it stops working. The version itself is never
bumped without approval. See [`../rules/versioning.md`](../rules/versioning.md).

## Scope

The scope is a section or subsystem, written lowercase in parentheses. Use the
real names in this repository: `site` for the published pages as a whole,
`github`, `gitlab`, `ai`, `mailer` for a documented area, and `agents`, `wiki`,
`logs`, `readme` for the non published trees.

## Subject

* Imperative mood: "add", not "added" or "adds".
* Plain text. No links, no pull request references, no issue references with `#`.
* No trailing period.
* Keep it short enough to read at a glance.

## Body

Optional. Short bullets explaining what changed and why. Never a transcript of the
session.

## Frequency

Commit each logical change or each group of related changes as you go. Never batch
a whole session into one commit. Always review the diff before creating a commit.

## Worked Example

A change that adds a page for a new GitLab function and links it from the landing
page:

```
git add docs/gitlab/archive/index.html
git commit -m "docs(gitlab): add page for archiveRepos"

git add docs/index.html
git commit -m "docs(site): link the archiveRepos page from the landing page"
```

Two logical changes, two commits, each reviewed before it was made.
